I wondered if I need this? I know my strengths - mathematics, exact sciences, all sorts of calculations, but at the same time I am an activist. I can not stand still. What I would like to point out is creative work, and you can create everything that comes to mind to you or a client. It is also constant self-improvement, constant advancement. This science does not stand still, it is constantly transforming and developing, which allows you to keep your finger on the pulse and keep up. A big plus profession - relevance and high pay. That is, fully work for yourself. Unemployment is definitely not a threat, since in the near future programming will be in increasing demand.
                    Every day I take steps towards my goal and towards what I want to do in the near future. At the main and higher base levels I own: C ++, C #, My SQL, Oracle, Git, HTML, JS, CCS, Photoshop,
